No. If you're on GamStop, you cannot access UKGC-licensed sites, including bonuses.

Non-UKGC operators are illegal to advertise in the UK and offer no consumer protection. Stick to UKGC-licensed operators.

### Can I claim multiple welcome bonuses?

No. Each bonus is for new customers only. Bonus abuse can result in account closure and winnings voided.

### What if an operator refuses to pay?

Use ADR services (IBAS, eCOGRA). If still unresolved, complain to UKGC. Your funds are protected by UK law.

### Do I need to verify my identity?

Yes. UKGC requires all operators to verify identity, age, and address before allowing withdrawals (sometimes before deposits).
